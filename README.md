Brief Description
-----------------
Conflict Browser is an analysis tool for visualizing and collecting information about the world’s conflicts. You can view libraries of conflicts that users have made before you, or you can create a library yourself.
Set up is easy, just run “node app” from the directory and go to port 8889/static/index.html to get started.

For more information regarding concepts used and our design process look at GradingHelp.pdf.
